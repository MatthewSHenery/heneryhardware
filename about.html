  My name is Matthew Henery, and I am taking CIS 155 at Olympic College.  As part of the course, we are required to design our first website from scratch.  For mine, I am designing a site for our family business, "Henery Hardware".  <!--M1LO13 ðŸ”¨ (3) Demonstrate using 3 types of hyperlinks: site navigation, targeted location using ids, and external (this item should be specified 3 times, once on each type of link).  Here I demonstrated an external hyperlink. --><a href="https://www.heneryhardware.com">We have a website at the moment, but due to the platform we created it on, we have limited things we can add to it</a>.  I started version one on January 19th, 2019, and continued to work on it until January 22nd, 2019.  In version one, I created all of the pages that are on my website.
</p>
    <!--M1LO7 ðŸ”¨ (3) Demonstrate the use of ordered and unordered lists.  Here I created an organized list to explain what pages I created.-->
    
    <ol class="about-list">
        <li>My pages:
            <ol>
                <li>Home Page</li>
                <li>Locations Page</li>
                <li>Services Pages</li>
               <li>Contact Us Page</li>
               <li>About This Project Page(This page your on)</li>
               <li>Departments Page</li>
            </ol>
    </ol>
    <p class="about-text">I only added details to the "Home Page" and "About This Project Page" however, I did make a comment on all of my other pages explaining that this would come in a future version.  On each page I created a link just like this page to return back to the home page.  The CSS complimemts this by adding different font, font sizes, dressing up quotes and links and most obvioulsy, adding color.

        In this Version, I pretty much started my code from scratch.  I kept using all of the images, colors, pages, and general idea of what I wanted, but after drawing out what I wanted my page to look like, I changed it vastly and decided starting over would be better<br><br>
        To my header I added a drop down shop by department, a separate header that says "free shipping on all ship to store orders", a search bar, "my account" a cart logo, as well as the image.  In a third "header", I created a horizontal nav with the ability to go to the home screen, the locations page, services, contact us, as well as this page.<br><br>
        I also added information to the locations page and the contact page, and redesigned the layout of my home page.

    In this version of my webpage I created my information for my "services" page.  I added a table with the different rentals we offer.  I also added an image of screen repair that I got from http://www.windowsavenue.com/services/screens-repair/window-screen-repair-and-replacement.html and gave a little bit of information about different services.
