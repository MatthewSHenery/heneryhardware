      <h2 class="about-hh">Reviews</h2>
      <blockquote> I can't imagine that there would be anything you'd need that you couldn't find at Henery's Hardware.  But the wonderfully helpful customer service is a tremendous asset to the business.</blockquote>
      <blockquote> I am constantly amazed at how much they cram into this store. It's like someone took a big box store, distilled it to essentials, turned a shrink ray onto what was left, and then added staff who are both helpful and clueful.<p></p>

      I use Amazon a lot because I value my time: their interface lets you quickly drill down through a large selection to find what you need. But I also value local merchants who can provide something that I need Right Now and who give back to the community. So when I need hardware-ish things in Port Townsend, I always check Henery before ordering from Amazon. Several times, the staff has pointed me at things that I was honestly surprised to find (like Waddell table legs, when I wanted to make a half-door into a table).</blockquote>
      <blockquote> I rent power washers and airless sprayer from them a lot. If I ever run into any problems with their equipment they fix the problem and give me a discount on the rental.</blockquote>
      <blockquote> The staff is the best of ANY hardware store I have been into.  The are helpful, knoledgeable, and very friendly.  The store is well stocked to meet all you needs as well.</blockquote>
      <blockquote> Ladies and Gents, the other reviews about the staff are indeed true. I always leave with what I need and a smile on my face.</blockquote>
