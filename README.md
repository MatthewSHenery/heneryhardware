This is my CIS 155 readme for my repo.  It's supposed to show up on GitHub but Prof. G hasn't shown us that yet.

My project is about the hardware store that my family has owned since 1994.  All the numbers are for test purposes only, and does not actually mean anything.

I hope you enjoy, and if you ever want to shop at henery hardware, our real website is "https://www.heneryhardware.com"
